            <h1>MOSFET Performance</h1>
            <p1>To design an amplifier, the properties of the transistor must be understood. MOFETs are nonlinear 4-terminal devices that allow for many basic functions in most circuits to
            be possible. MOSFET stands for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor, describing
            how the body of the device is made and functions. This device has 4 terminals, the gate,
            source, drain and body. These terminals can be powered in certain ways to achieve different
            results. Generally the body will be tied to the source of the MOSFET or grounded, as the body
            has to be tied to the lowest potential of the circuit to maintain the polarity of the MOSFET and
            prevent the body effect. MOSFETS can make use of free electrons or electron “holes” to create
            a channel that allows electrons to flow from the source to the drain, when under the influence of
            a strong enough field. This is done by “doping” the substrate with either holes or electrons which
            determines if the transistor is an n-MOS or p-MOS.

                MOSFETs can be used to replace many components as they can take up considerably less
                area which can be very expensive on a chip. For example, connecting the gate and the drain of
                a MOSFET (called a gated diode) can act as an active resistor, which can have a variable
                resistance and takes up much less area than a resistor. The experiments in this lab study how
                changing the lengths of the n-mos and p-mos transistors affect different parameters and their
                functions. The parameters include:

                <h1>Operating Principle</h1>
                <p>The MOSFET can function in the three following modes: cutoff, linear and saturation. First it is
                    important to discuss important parameters of the MOSFET. V<sub>t</sub>
                    is the threshold voltage
                    determined by the design and technology of the MOSFET. K<sub>n</sub>' is the transconductance
                    parameter of the transistor, dependent on the electron mobility, width/length ratio, and gate
                    oxide capacitance. λ is the channel length modulation, impacting the stability of the current for a
                    variable V<sub>GS</sub>, where a smaller CLM is desired and results in a flatter ID curve in the saturation
                    region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cutoff region is when the MOSFET is “off”, it is not conducting and has no channel for electron
    flow. When the voltage across the gate and source is less than the threshold voltage. The
    transistor is in the linear region when V<sub>GS</sub> is greater than V<sub>T</sub>, but the voltage difference between
    the drain and source is less than the difference between V<sub>GS</sub> and V<sub>T</sub>. In this region, the I<sub>DS</sub>
    increases linearly with V<sub>DS</sub> hence the name. This region is undesirable for current source
    applications due to the slope of the I<sub>DS</sub> curve. The I<sub>DS</sub> in this region increases with V<sub>DS</sub> as the
    channel between the drain and the source is forming, and increasing in length in the MOSFET.
    When V<sub>DS</sub> is greater than V<sub>GS</sub>-V<sub>T</sub> the transistor is in the saturation region, meaning V<sub>D</sub> must be
    higher than V<sub>G</sub>-V<sub>T</sub>. This is when the channel for electron flow is fully formed, and the same
    amount of current is flowing with an increasing V<sub>DS</sub>, it can be said the channel is fully saturated. From the IV characteristics the current in the drain can be modeled with the following equation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$i_D = \frac{1}{2}k'_n\left(\frac{W}{L}\right)(v_{GS} - V_{tn})^2 (1 + \lambda v_{DS})$$
